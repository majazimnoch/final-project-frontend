# Problems

I encountered difficulties with using styling components together with Hash Link (BrowserRouter), that's why in the end I replaced Styled components with Vanilla CSS for the nav links (which are navigating to the links on the same page) / Maja. 

## NPM packages installed for the frontend repo:
- npm i
- npm i react-router-dom
- npm i styled-components@latest
- npm i react-redux
- npm i @â€Œreduxjs/toolkit
- npm i moment
- npm i swiper
- npm install --save react-router-hash-link

## Usage

1. On GitHub, click the 'use this template' button to create a new repo on your account
1. Clone the new repo to your computer
1. Install required dependencies with npm: `npm install`
1. Start the project: `npm start`
